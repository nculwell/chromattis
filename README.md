# [Chromattis](https://captainstack.github.io/chromattis/)
Chromattis is a simple, fun, challenging puzzle game by [Andre Stackhouse](https://captainstack.github.io/public-stackhouse/portfolio/). Do you have the brains to solve it?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://captainstack.github.io/chromattis/).

To build:
npm install
npm run build

To serve, publish the build directory as "/chromattis" on your web server.

For testing, you can run the lighttpd/lighttpd-serve script, which will start /usr/sbin/lighttpd running with the game located in the root directory and in /chromattis.
